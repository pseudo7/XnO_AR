# XnO AR

## A simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe in Unity3D.
## Using Vuforia SDK and **User Defined Targets**, the game doesn't require any specific `Image Target`.

**Sidenote: Click on the capture button when the target quality is `High`.**

## This game has 2 gameplay modes, viz. 
* **Player vs Player**
* **Player vs AI**

## The `Player vs AI` gameplay has 3 difficulty modes:
1. Easy
2. Medium
3. Hard

**Easy Mode:** It is for children or toddlers :wink:

**Medium Mode:** This mode requires a bit of thinking but still is easy to defeat the AI with some practice.

**Hard Mode:** It is impossible to win from the AI, but you can still draw the game and try not to lose. :smirk:
